# Web Development using the EVE API

It's great fun playing games, but what if you could use your coding skills to interact with an online game and create apps for the mobile phone, or desktop?

Well, an Application Programming Interface (API) allows you to connect two systems using code, in this case - I'm connecting a statically generated website made in Hugo - to the EVE Online Universe using an API.

EVE is a massively multiplayer online universe where you can explore, mine, bounty hunt and well all manner of spacefaring activity.

This project serves as an example of how we use web based APIs to read, write and delete data inside a game, in fact - not just games, this is how the web is built. We use one API after another to enrich our web applications to do more meaningful things.

I just want this project to be a bit of fun where you can poke and prod the EVE Online universe, just as you could say - a weather forecasting API.

Once you understand the principles for one, the general concepts are largely the same.

## A few words on GitHub

My advice is start using source control as soon as you can, get familar with the ideas of how to clone, commit, push, pull and all these other fancy thoughts.

This is part of modern engineering practices, and you must understand this stuff. We live in a software defined world now, everything has some software running behind it and you need to be able to fit into a team, or, use source control to manage your own day to day work.

I don't want to dwell anymore on it, just consider it a critical skill you need. If you want to know
